# What is this ?
Here are all the discord bot I created.   
It was my first real development project, that's why it's not perfect and it deserves a little cleaning and future improvement.     

# How can I use ? 
You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) to use this.
You can run it on some software like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# Credits
